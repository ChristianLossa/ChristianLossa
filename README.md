- Hi, I’m @ChristianLossa
- I’m interested in learning everything about programming
- I’m currently learning to program in c++ and python and I've started learning about cybersecurity and pentesting.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects. I've been making my own as well, but I really just want some hands on practice more than anything.
